## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has **two** classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* Returns what to be printed out on the UI

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the address book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info"> 

:information_source: 

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>

![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the address book data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented. The details of the features are
categorized accordingly to the entities. Specifically: Bidder, Seller, Bid, Property and Meeting.

### 1. Bidder / Seller
 
 Despite being two separate entities, bidder and seller entities will be presented together in the implementation as
 both entities are very similar in terms of implementation.
 
 ### **Implementation**
 
 #### 1.1 **Delete**: delete a bidder / seller - `delete-b` or `delete-s`
 
 `delete` is supported by the `DeleteBidderCommand` and `DeleteSellerCommand`.
 
 Given below is the example usage scenario:
 
 **Step 1**. The user launches the PropertyFree application. 
 
 **Step 2**. After loading data from the storage to the application memory,
 the list of `bidders` or `sellers` in the `BidderAddressBook` and `SellerAddressBook` can either contain existing bidders
 or sellers, or is empty. However, as we are deleting existing bidders or sellers, we will assumed that there are
 bidders or sellers in the book.
 
 **Step 3**. The user then executes `delete-b <INDEX>`. If the `<INDEX>` is out of bound. PropertyFree will give a 
 display error message indicating that the index is wrong.
 
 **Step 4**. The application will then retrieve the corresponding bidder or seller, delete it, and return a new list without the
 corresponding bidder or seller.
 
 The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes `delete-b` or `delete-s` command:
 
 ![DeleteBidderActivityDiagram](images/BidderDeleteActivityDiagram.png)
 
 The following sequence diagram summarises as well how the components of Model and Logic interact during the execution
 of the command:
 
 ![DeleteBidderSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteBidderSequenceDiagram.png)

 #### Design Considerations
 
 1. Alternative 1 (current choice): Displays the list in the appropriate tab accordingly, depending on the relevant
 entity of the command. (i.e `delete-b` will bring the application to the bidder tab automatically.)
    
    - Pros: Automatic switching of tabs allows user to switch between tabs without having to 
    interact with the GUI. 
    - Cons: User may not desire to switch tabs automatically even if a command is given for the relevant entity.
 
 2. Alternative 2: Have a separate window for bidder and sellers.

    - Pros: Neater UI and improves usability for the agent.
    - Cons: More command lines will be required if user wants to close the separate window.
 
 #### 1.2 **Find**: find bidder(s) and seller(s) based on their names - `find-b` or `find-s`
 
  `find` is supported by the `FindBidderCommand` and `FindSellerCommand`.
  
  Given below is the example usage scenario:
  
  **Step 1**. The user launches the PropertyFree application. 
  
  **Step 2**. After loading data from the storage to the application memory,
  the list of `bidders` or `sellers` in the `BidderAddressBook` and `SellerAddressBook` can either contain existing bidders
  or sellers, or is empty. However, as we are finding existing bidders or sellers, we will assumed that there are
  bidders or sellers in the book.
  
  **Step 3**. The user then executes `find-b <KEYWORD>`. If the `<KEYWORD>` does not corresponding to any names
   in the list of bidders and seller. PropertyFree will display an error message indicating that the search result is
   empty.
   
  **Step 4**. If the `<KEYWORD>` matches any names (in part or whole), the list will then filter the bidders or sellers
  whose name do not match the `<KEYWORD>`, and return a list of bidders or sellers whose name contains the `<KEYWORD>`.
  
   The following sequence diagram summarises as well how the components of Model and Logic interact during the execution
   of the command:
   
   ![FindBidderSequenceDiagram](images/FindBidderSequenceDiagram.png)
 
   #### Design Consideration
   
   1. Alternative Implementation 1 (current choice): The bidder and sellers are stored in an 
   `ObservableList<Bidder/Seller>`.
        - Pros: Easier to implement and do not require refactoring for the existing code base
        - Cons: The class (`Observable`) is deprecated since Java 9 due lack of functionality.
        
   2. Alternative Implementation 2: using of java.beans package instead of Observable
        - Pros: to replace the deprecated `Observable` class since Java 9. Greater number of functions, such
        as being able to keep track of what has changed.
        - Cons: Will require heavy edits to the existing code base.
 

### 2. Bid

 ### **Implementation**

 #### 2.1 **Delete**: delete a bid - `delete-bid`

 `delete` is supported by the `DeleteBidCommand`.

 Given below is the example usage scenario:

 **Step 1**. The user launches the PropertyFree application. 

 **Step 2**. After loading data from the storage to the application memory,
 the list of `bids` `BidBook` can either contain existing bids or is empty. However, as we are deleting existing bids, we will assume that there are
 bids in the book.

 **Step 3**. The user then executes `delete-bid <INDEX>`. If the `<INDEX>` is out of bound. PropertyFree will give a 
 display error message indicating that the index is wrong.

 **Step 4**. The application will then retrieve the corresponding bid, delete it, and return a new list without the
 corresponding bid.

 The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes `delete-bid` command:

 ![DeleteBidActivityDiagram](images/BidDeleteActivityDiagram.png)

 The following sequence diagram summarises as well how the components of Model and Logic interact during the execution
 of the command:

 ![DeleteBidSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteBidSequenceDiagram.png)

 #### Design Considerations

 1. Alternative 1 (current choice): Delete-bid command will delete a bid based on the index in the list.

    - Pros: Users can easily distinguish which bid they wish to delete. 
    - Cons: User will not be able to delete a large number at one go.

 2. Alternative 2: Delete not based on index but by property.

    - Pros: user can delete all the bids for a property once it is sold.
    - Cons: It may delete the winning bid from the list which may be undesirable.
    

 #### 2.2 **LIST**: display the list of bids - `list-bid`

 `list` is supported by the `ListBidCommand`.

 Given below is the example usage scenario:

 **Step 1**. The user launches the PropertyFree application. 

 **Step 2**. After loading data from the storage to the application memory,
 the list of `bids` `BidBook` can either contain existing bids, is empty, or not showing the entire list.

 **Step 3**. The user then executes `list-bid`.

 **Step 4**. The application will then return a full list of bids.

 The following sequence diagram summarises how the components of Model and Logic interact during the execution
 of the command:

 ![ListBidSequenceDiagram](images/ListBidSequenceDiagram.png)

 #### Design Considerations

 1. Alternative 1 (current choice): List-bid command will display all bids in the list based on when it was added.

    - Pros: Users can easily see the entire list and know which bids were added first. 
    - Cons: User will not be able easily see bids related to a certain property or bidder.

 2. Alternative 2: List will also sort the list of bids based on property.

    - Pros: user can see all the bids easily for a certain property.
    - Cons: Chronological order of being added will not be seen.
    
    
### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![CommitActivityDiagram](images/CommitActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### \[Proposed\] Data archiving

_{Explain here how the data archiving feature will be implemented}_

### Property Feature

#### Add Property Feature 

The Add Property feature adds a property with the user defined attributes, such as property name, address,
seller id, property type, asking price and is-rental, into the property book.

1. ```LogicManager``` executes the user input. 
2. It calls ```AddressBookParser``` to parse the user input, which creates an ```AddPropertyCommandParser```, as 
identified by the command word "add-p".
3. The ```AddPropertyCommandParser``` creates a ```Property``` object, with attributes specified by the user.
4. The ```AddPropertyCommandParser``` creates an ```AddPropertyCommand``` with the above property. The command
is returned to the ```LogicManager```.
5. The ```LogicManager``` calls ```AddPropertyCommand#execute()```, which adds the property to ```PropertyBook```
via the ```Model``` interface.
6. Finally, a ```CommandResult``` with the relevant feedback is returned to the ```LogicManager```.

The following sequence diagram shows the process of executing an ```AddPropertyCommand```.
![AddPropertySequenceDiagram](images/property/AddPropertySequenceDiagram.png)

##### Property Id Management

Each property is identified by a unique ```PropertyId``` in the form of a number prefixed by "P". As each property is
added, the property id is auto-incremented. The following activity diagram shows how the property id is managed:

![AddPropertyIdManagementActivityDiagram](images/property/AddPropertyIdManagementActivityDiagram.png)

This process occurs inside the ```UniquePropertyList``` class.  

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Note 2: User-created properties always have the DEFAULT_ID. Users are not allowed to set or edit 
```PropertyId```s to ensure the uniqueness of the property id. Only ```Property``` objects created 
for testing purposes may have manually-added ```PropertyId```s, in which case, the ```PropertyId``` 
will be retained. 

</div>

### Meeting Feature

#### Find Meeting Feature
The find meeting feature finds meetings with various different inputs. The user is able to find meetings based on 
attributes such as venue, time, bidderId or the propertyId. The user simply has to use the relevant prefixes and add
in a string that is contained in any of the meetings attributes and the fid feature will return you a list of the 
meetings that contain them.

1. ```LogicManager``` executes the user input. 
2. It calls ```AddressBookParser``` to parse the user input, which creates an ```FindMeetingCommandParser```, as 
identified by the command word "find-m".
3. The ```FindMeetingCommandParser``` creates different predicate objects based on the inputs.
 if "/v" is used, ```VenueContainsKeywordsPredicate``` object will be created. If "/t" is used, ```TimeContainsKeywordsPredicate``` 
 object will be created. If "/b" is used, ```BidderIdContainsKeywordsPredicateobject``` will be created. If "/p" is used, 
 ```PropertyIdContainsKeywordsPredicate``` object will be created.
4. The ```FindMeetingCommandParser``` creates an ```FindMeetingCommand``` with the above predicate. The command
is returned to the ```LogicManager```.
5. The ```LogicManager``` calls ```FindMeetingCommand#execute()```, which adds the list of meetings that satisfy the predicate
 into ```MeetiongBook``` via the ```Model``` interface.
6. Finally, a ```CommandResult``` with the relevant feedback is returned to the ```LogicManager```.

The following sequence diagram shows the process of executing an ```FindMeetingCommand```.
![FineMeetingActivityDiagram](images/meeting/FindMeetingActivityDiagram.png)
  
#### Sort Meeting Feature
The sort meeting feature sorts the meetings based on the different timings of the meetings from the earliest meeting
to the last meeting in chronological order.
1. ```LogicManager``` executes the user input. 
2. It calls ```AddressBookParser``` to parse the user input, which creates an ```SortMeetingCommandParser```, as 
identified by the command word "sort-m".
3. The ```SortMeetingCommandParser``` creates a ```SortMeetingComparator``` comparator object.
4. The ```SortMeetingCommandParser``` creates a ```SortMeetingCommand``` with the above comparator. The command
is returned to the ```LogicManager```.
5. The ```LogicManager``` calls ```SortMeetingCommand#execute()```, which adds a new duplicate list of meetings that is
 sorted in chronological order in ```MeetingBook``` via the ```Model``` interface.
6. Finally, a ```CommandResult``` with the relevant feedback is returned to the ```LogicManager```.
